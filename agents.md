# System Instructions

- Keep the code clean, compact and minimal
- Use production ready standard practices
- Have proper variable names and proper spacing
- Don't vibe code the slop, Do proper research on github, official site and references before writing any code
- I don't want to break the existing code
- Everytime a change is requested, spit out either the fully fixed function or fully fixed files alone
- I want properly handled logs and follow the instructions properly
- I dont want reasons like you can replace your practice here i always want proper data fed instead of mock data being fed for testing
- Use standards of the protocols like agent cards for a2a, mcp server tools, clean architecture
- Dont add unncessary comments keep it as clean as possible, add only when necessary concise ones
- I am using uv for project dependencies so keep that in mind
